* This is a z/OS hardware capability that allows the user's virtual addresses to be translated into real addresses when interpreted by the processor.

### Data Set
> ğŸ’¡ _A data set is functionaly the same as a Unix file even though data sets are structurally different from Unix files._
* Functionally speaking, a data set is just a file.

### DASD *(Direct Access Storage Device)*
> ğŸ’¡ _This is like the z/OS version of the SSDs and hard drives you use on your PC._
* A disk device.

### DB2
> ğŸ’¡ _Note that DB2 is optimized to leverage z/OS capabilities._

### DFSMS *(Data Facility Storage Management)*
* z/OS component for managing storage.

### DFSMSdfp
* Part of DFSMS that provides functions for storage, data, device, and program management.

### DFSMSdss
* Part of DFSMS that provides utilities for copying and moving data.

### DFSMShsm *(Hierarchical Storage Manager)*
* Data storage technique that moves data between low and high cost storage devices. DFSMShsm also backup and disaster recovery capabilities.

### DLIB *(Distribution Library)*
* Contains an entire copy of the z/OS product. This is used by SMPE as a local repository where new APARs and PTFs can be added, and the updates can be installed from this repository when the organization is ready. DLIBs may also be used for backup.

### DSLIST *(Data Set List)*
> ğŸ’¡ _This is analogous to the ls command on Linux._
* This is the panel in ISPF used to list data sets.

### DSN *(Data Set Name)*

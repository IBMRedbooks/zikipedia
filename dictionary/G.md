### Green Screen

{: .note }
> _Think of SSH._

* This is the traditional terminal interface for interacting with the MVS side of z/OS _(TSO and ISPF)_. This is a synonym for 3270. The reason 3270 terminal interfaces are refered to green screens is because most of the text is green on a black background.
